 # FloowDrive Automation
 
 Firstly, apologies on this being late. I have wrote a few automated tests for various functions on the app such as login, registering a user, checking data on the home page and ensuring that the number of journeys is consistent through the app

Easiest way to download the code is via the download link in github! 

I have developed the automation tests using a real device (iOS) using technologies such as:

* Java 8
* Selenium
* Appium
* XCode
* J Unit 5

mvn clean install will package a jar to run or tests can be run via eclipse. However you will need to configure the application.properties file to your own credentials for the desired capabilities
